### Main Components:
1) Unity Game
2) Raspberry Pi Sensor Software
3) Python Server

#### How to Run Python Server:
1. Define host IP address in HOST definition if not wifi0
2. Run with:

	```python
	python server.py
	```
	
#### How to Run Raspberry Pi Sensor Software:
1. Define server IP address in data_collect() function
2. Define wireless interface name in HOST definition if not wlan0
3. Copy file pi_socket.py to Raspberry Pi and connect necessary hardware (BerryIMU)
4. Run program on Pi with:
	
	```python
	python bow_sensors.py
	```
	
Note: It is **critical** to start server before Pi and Unity software to properly initialize
the UDP sockets. Also, UDP ports 10000 and 10002 must be opened in the firewall.

Known Issues
1. Server and Raspberry Pi software cannot be closed with Ctrl-C. Must do a hard shutdown.
